Hardware overview
- Microcontroller: A compact Arduino-compatible board forms the control brain.
- Tachometer: A non-contact or optical or hall-effect tachometer sensor interface to measure spindle RPM.
- VFD interface: An analog 0–10V or PWM output connected to the VFD’s speed input. The firmware supports common ranges and scales values to your spindle needs.
- Power: A shared power rail for logic and sensors, with appropriate isolation and fusing. A separate path may be used for the spindle drive if your setup requires it.
- 3D printed case: A robust enclosure with standoffs, cable routing channels, and cooling considerations. The design ships with STLs and OpenSCAD files for easy customization.
- Connectors and cabling: Shielded/low-noise cabling for the tachometer and VFD signal lines; clearly labeled headers for ease of build.

Electrical and wiring guide
- Power rails: Use a clean DC supply for the controller and sensors. Keep spindle power separate from logic if your setup runs hot or long runs.
- Tachometer wiring: Route tachometer signal lines away from high-current motor leads to reduce noise. Use shielding where practical.
- VFD connection: Use an optically isolated or isolated signal path if your VFD requires it. Many VFDs accept 0–10V or PWM; pick the method your drive supports.
- Grounding: Tie all grounds to a common reference point on the controller side. Keep chassis ground separate if your case design provides it.
- Signal levels: Validate voltage levels with a multimeter before connecting to the VFD. Do not exceed the maximum input range of the VFD’s control input.
- Safety: Ensure all wiring is secure, uses appropriate strain relief, and is routed away from moving parts or sharp edges. Never operate the lathe with the case open.

3D printed case and enclosure
- Design goals: Quiet operation, good air flow, and accessible connectors. The case supports mounting on a bench or directly on tooling equipment.
- Printing considerations: Use a strong material like PETG or ABS for durability and heat resistance. Print with a solid infill and strong wall thickness to resist vibration.
- Assembly: The case is designed for a modular approach. The board slides into a chassis, connectors align through cutouts, and screws fasten the board standoffs to the enclosure.
- Cable management: The design includes cable channels and cable glands to keep wiring neat and reduce noise pickup.
- OpenSCAD family: In addition to STL files, the repository includes OpenSCAD sources so you can adjust dimensions, cutouts, and mounting options easily.

OpenSCAD and CAD resources
- OpenSCAD: The primary CAD workflow for the enclosure uses OpenSCAD to generate STL files from parametric designs. This lets you adjust screw positions, port cutouts, and enclosure geometry quickly.
- CAD files: STL assets are provided for printing. If you want to customize, modify the OpenSCAD script and re-export the STL.
- Best practices: Keep tolerances tight enough for reliable fits, but generous enough to allow easy assembly. Test fit with a small number of printed parts before committing to a full print.

Firmware and software
- Firmware: A lean, Arduino-compatible sketch handles input, output, and the tachometer display. It focuses on reliability and predictable performance.
- Tachometer: The firmware reads from the tachometer sensor, calculates RPM, and updates the display in real time.
- VFD control: The firmware outputs a 0–10V (or PWM where supported) command to the VFD to manage spindle speed. A scaling map converts target RPM to the appropriate control value.
- UI and commands: Simple command set for basic lathe functions, tool changes, and spindle control. The goal is straightforward operation rather than a heavy interface.
- Calibration and tuning: The software includes a calibration mode to align the tachometer reading with actual RPM and to verify the VFD response curve.
- Safety logic: The firmware enforces safe startup behavior and prevents abrupt changes to spindle speed that could surprise the operator.

Getting started
- Prerequisites: A compatible Arduino-compatible board, a VFD that supports 0–10V or PWM input, a tachometer sensor, a 3D printed case, and a suitable power supply.
- Tools: Soldering iron, wire cutters, multimeter, basic hand tools for mounting, and a 3D printer or access to printing service.
- What you get: A ready-to-wire controller, a tachometer display, a VFD interface, and a printable enclosure with assembly instructions.

Getting started with the hardware
- Prepare the board: Check voltage levels, verify the microcontroller bootloader, and configure any required jumpers for your board.
- Prepare the VFD: Confirm the input type (0–10V or PWM) and ensure the drive is powered separately from the controller. Do not share grounds with high-current motor circuits unless the design calls for it.
- Tachometer setup: Install the tachometer sensor at the appropriate spindle point. Calibrate the sensor according to the firmware’s tachometer calibration instructions.
- Enclosure assembly: Print the enclosure, insert the board, route cables through the designed channels, and secure the board with standoffs.
- Cable harness: Build a clean wiring harness with shielded or twisted pair cables for signal lines. Label connectors to prevent miswiring.
- First power-on: Connect power, check startup behavior, verify that the tachometer reads RPM when the spindle is turned, and confirm the VFD responds to speed commands.

Assembly steps
- Step 1: Print the enclosure and mount hardware in the chassis layout that matches your lathe.
- Step 2: Attach the tachometer sensor and route its cable. Connect it to the controller board at the designated header.
- Step 3: Wire the VFD control line from the controller to the VFD input. Use the chosen control method (0–10V or PWM) and ensure shielded wiring if the environment is noisy.
- Step 4: Connect power supplies for logic and motor, ensuring clean ground references. Use fuses as required for protection.
- Step 5: Load and flash the firmware onto the controller. Use the provided bootload or a standard upload method for your board.
- Step 6: Verify that all LEDs illuminate and that the tachometer updates in real time as the spindle rotates.
- Step 7: Run a basic test program to verify spindle control, tachometer reading, and safety features.

Calibration and tuning
- Tachometer calibration: Compare the tachometer reading with a known RPM source. Adjust the firmware scale until the display equals the live RPM.
- VFD response: Test the speed ramp and ensure the spindle accelerates smoothly without overshoot. Adjust the speed ramp parameters if your lathe tends to accel too quickly.
- RPM stability: Run light cuts or idle tests to confirm that the spindle maintains a steady RPM under load conditions typical for your workflow.
- Threshold checks: Ensure the system handles power interruptions gracefully and returns to a safe state on reboot.

Operation modes
- Manual mode: Directly control spindle speed with a hardware knob or a software command. Use this mode for setup and calibration.
- Auto mode: Run a simple job script or a small G-code subset that demonstrates coordinated turning operations.
- Safety mode: The system keeps a safe startup sequence and avoids rapid speed changes that could cause tool chatter or damage.
- Tachometer readout: The display shows RPM in real time, helping you monitor cutting conditions and adjust feeds.

Testing and validation
- Unit tests: Verify each subsystem independently—tachometer, VFD interface, power management, and enclosure fit.
- Integration tests: Confirm the controller responds to all inputs, updates the display correctly, and maintains stable speed during simulated loads.
- Real-world tests: Run a few light passes on scrap material to validate tool engagement, chip formation, and surface finish. Watch for overheating or warning signals from the VFD or controller.

Maintenance and care
- Regular checks: Inspect cabling for wear, secure all fasteners, and verify that vent areas remain unobstructed to keep heat in check.
- Cleaning: Wipe the enclosure and terminals with a clean cloth. Avoid harsh liquids near electronics.
